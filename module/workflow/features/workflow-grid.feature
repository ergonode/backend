    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"

  Scenario: Create template
    When I send a POST request to "/api/v1/en/templates" with body:
      """
      {
        "name": "@@random_md5@@",
        "elements": []
      }

    Then the response status code should be 201
    And store response param "id" as "template_id"

  Scenario: Create product

        "type": "SIMPLE-PRODUCT",
        "templateId": "@template_id@"
      }
